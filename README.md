# WeatherApp
Mobile Android application that displays the current weather at a user-specified location using a city name and country name. Uses [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) and [WeatherLib](https://github.com/survivingwithandroid/WeatherLib) to take a user-typed city and 
a country name, selected from a Spinner, and return the current weather info for the first found location. The user can add cities to a list Fragment that is used to easily
switch between different locations. Cities can be added to the list, selected by clicking on them, and removed by long clicking.

# What I Learned
- How to communicate between multiple Fragments and the main Activity
- How to use an API
- How to use a GitHub Library using [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/)
